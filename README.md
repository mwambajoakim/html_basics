### HTML Basics

## Introduction

This is a basic portfolio website that highlights my knowledge in using HTML. It will have four pages;

1. **Home Page**
2. **Projects Page**
3. **Articles Page**
4. **Contact Page**

The details about the start date will be highlighted as a comment in the index.html page which is also the homepage.

I will also try to write comments in the pages as much as I can. The descriptions of what I have done will follow below.

## Home Page

The homepage of this project houses the navigation bar that has the links to the other pages of the portfolio website.
