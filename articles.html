            I have written with regards to the<br>

                    This project is not too different from the flexbox<br> 
                    project. I had to move some boxes around just to make<br> 
                    it appear as good as it turned out. Please <a href="https://github.com/mwambajoakim/landing_page/blob/main/README.md"></a>check this article I wrote about it.
